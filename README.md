# My-To-Do-List-App
I have been teaching myself Python for the last three months in order to become a programmer or a software developer and this is my first attemp at creating an application.
I'm using it not only as a chance to hone my coding skills but also as an oportunity to learn every nuance concerning committing and deploying code and the application itself.
