# My-To-Do-List-App
I have been teaching myself Python for the last three months in order to become a programmer or a software developer and this is my first attemp at creating an application.
I used a GUI package embedded in Python (TkInter) in order to create an interactive interface.
The application consists in a task list used as a "to-do" list, where the users can add tasks and remove them once the task is completed.
THe goal of this application is to not only use it as a chance to hone my coding skills but also as an oportunity to learn every nuance concerning committing and deploying code and the application itself.
This repository contains the python file and the executable of the application.
